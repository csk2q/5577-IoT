# Shared Types and Utilities

This directory contains TypeScript types and utilities shared between frontend and backend (if needed).

## Purpose

Maintain consistency in data structures across the entire application stack.

## Contents

- Type definitions that are used by both frontend and backend
- Validation schemas
- Common utility functions

## Usage

Types defined here should match the API contract specification exactly.

---

**Note**: Currently, types are duplicated in frontend/src/types/ and backend would use JSDoc comments. This directory is reserved for future consolidation if needed.
